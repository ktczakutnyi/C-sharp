Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
```
Constraints:
 - m == grid.length
 - n == grid[i].length
 - 1 <= m, n <= 300
 - grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

# *Let's brake down EVERYTHING* 

## 1. Method Declaration
   `Public Static int find_it(int[] seq)` - This line defines a function (method)

  - `Public` - This means any code can call this method. Not restricted to the class. "This funtion is visible to the outside world"

  - `Static` - means the function belongs to the class itself, not an of the class. Example: `Math.Abs(5)` we didnt create a math object, we only called it. Similar to an import in python

  - `int` - stands for integer. it means a whole number. this is the return type. it tells c# "This function will return an int"

  - `find_it` - this is the methods name. tbh it could be anything. But people like it to kinda make sence and be readable

  - `(int[] seq)` - this is parameter (input)

## 2.
`foreach(int num in seq)` - 

## 3. 
`int count = 0;` - 

## 4.
`foreach(int n in seq` -   

## 
`if(n==num)` - 

## 6.
`it(count%2==1)` - 

## 7. 
`return num` -  

## 8. 
`return =1` -

 ```
for each number
  count how many times it(the number) appears
  if the count is odd
    reaturn it
```
